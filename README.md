## TicTacToe

Simple TicTacToe game created using JS.

# Roadmap to Future Improvements:
I would like to see the "X" and "O" appear bigger and take up more space in the square, this could be changed by altering the size. i would also like something to happen when a winner is announced. This could be done by making the text stick out more or maybe a popup when someone wins the game.
